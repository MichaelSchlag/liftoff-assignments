# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

(pictures: tier list top left, alignment chart top right, XY chart bottom)
With the popularity of tier lists and alignment charts on social media, ranking opinions is a past-time held by tons of users of the internet. To capitalize on this, I am making a quick and easy-to-share application that creates XY charts. An XY chart squares the amount of data, which allows for two factors to be quantified for any amount of objects. They give a ton more to look at than a tier list, which gives much more information, which allows for more argument!

### Features
  - Chart creation: Ability to create XY charts - to upload images of items and place them on a chart of user-provided parameters
  - Chart sharing: Charts will have their own page and image render, making it easy to share
  - Voting: Ability for users to arrange items on an already created chart and submit it to create an average
  - User signup: Ability to create and sign in to an account that saves charts you have created or voted on
  - Home page: Features popular public charts, allowing users to get an idea of the concept and also vote

### Technologies
  - Java
  - HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - SQL
  - MAMP
  - Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn
First I will have to make a chart creation template, and I plan to use a drag-and-drop form, which I have never done before. I will also need to come up with MANY functions to make the chart work, including something to resize the images, something to fit the images on the chart without overlapping, something to determine what to do when items are on the same coordinate, and also a ton of validation to prevent people from making giant lop-sided charts that break the page. I didn't list it on my features, but I do intend to add a search feature toward the end and I do not even know where to start for that. A big thing I need to learn, though, is how to even begin a project like this. CheeseMVC and TechJobs spared me the process of actually setting up a project and learning that aspect of IntelliJ. And finally, I am going to have to learn how to tackle something like this. I always do big chunks of work closer to the deadline out of habit, so I am going to have to learn how to force myself to do a little bit of work every day.
